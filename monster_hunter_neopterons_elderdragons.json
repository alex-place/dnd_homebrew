				"The Vespoid Queen releases a corrosive gas from her stinger in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If a creature in that area has a nonmagical weapon made of metal, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed."
